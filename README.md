# Advanced-Peripherals-Documentation

This is the source of the documentation from advanced peripherals.
The documentation is build with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). 
I recommend to use mkdocs if you want to contribute, but you do not need to.

# Contribute

If you want to contribute, you can edit the file you want to edit or create even a new file.
You can use mkdocs if you want to see your changes live.
