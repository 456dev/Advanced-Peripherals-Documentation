## Features

### Integrated Dynamics Integration

We added a peripheral to the "Variable Store" Block from Integrated Dynamics to read variables from integrated dynamics. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see [here](../1.19/integrations/getstarted.md) how you can use these new features.

### Storage Drawer Integration

You can now access storage drawers. Store items, push items, pull items or does what ever you want to do with items. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see [here](../1.16/integrations/sd/drawer.md) how you can use these new features.

### Geo Scanner

The [Geo Scanner](../1.19/peripherals/geo_scanner.md) provides information about blocks around him and the chunk of the geo scanner. You could use it to search in the near or analyze ores in a chunk.

### Block Reader

With the [Block Reader](../1.19/peripherals/block_reader.md) you can read data of blocks and tile entites. You can simply place the blocks in front of it to access it.

With this block, you're able to store tables or other values. You can simply read and write values with the functions of it. Take a look at the [documentation](../1.19/peripherals/nbt_storage.md).

### New Turtles Upgrades

New powerful turtle upgrades! With this small upgrades you finally can use any tools just from turtle inventories, perform right click on blocks, collect items in small range, transport animals and much more! But be aware, the new abilities require fuel and most of them have a cooldown. Big thanks to SirEdvin who made this upgrades.

### New Ingame Documentation

Advanced Peripherals does now use [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli) to generate an ingame documentation. You can now easy get help without the need of an internet browser.
