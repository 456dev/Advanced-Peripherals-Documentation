# Storage System Functions

Starting from AP 0.8 and 0.7 for 1.21.1, the ME and RS Bridge both now share the same functionality along with the new
crafting system.
The following functions can be used for both the ME and RS Bridge

!!! failure
    <center> <h3> You need to place the inventory/tank you want to use to export/import stuff next to the ME/RS Bridge and *
    *NOT** next to the computer! <h3> </center>

!!! tip
    You can use the command `/advancedperipherals getHashItem` with an item in your hand to get the MD5 hash of the NBT tags
    of the item. An MD5 Hash can look like this `-682649218295023`.

## Crafting System and functions

Since 0.8 and beta 0.7 for 1.21.1 we created a new crafting system for both the ME and RS Bridge
The functionality is mostly the same but since the RS api is currently not as extensive as the AE2 api, the RS Craft Job
may miss some functions.

The craft function now returns an object instead of a boolean. Using that object is optional.
That object contains information about the job, if it was canceled, what was requested, what items may miss if
calculation was not successful and much more.

Crafting is in both RS and AE async. If you request a feature, it calculates the recipe in the background and if that
was successful it starts the task.
To support that in a simple way on a users end, we created that custom object.

When you schedule a task, it firsts starts calculation in the background and sends an event that the item is either not
craftable or the calculation was started.
If calculation is done, there are several things that can happen. If the calculation was not successful and there were
missing items, it fires the crafting event with the message "MISSING_ITEMs".
The missing items can be retrieved using the object's function `getMissingItems`.
Depending on if you use RS or AE2, it also may return other debug messages if the calculation was nto successful like
overflow or cycle detected.

If the calculation was successful, the event will fire with the message `CRAFTING_STARTED` and then starts the crafting.

There are now two ways to track the progress. the `crafting` event will fire when the crafting is done, it was canceled
or if other things might happen that affects the task.
The event also gives you an id to get the crafting object you would also get from the initial `craftX` function. Simply
use `getCraftingJob` to get the object.

The other way is to regularly check if the crafting is done or canceled by calling the objects `isDone` or `isCanceled`
function.
Using the event is more simple there.

Every function and property is described in more details below.

### Crafting Event

The new crafting event will be fired when the state of a task will change.

The name of the event is prefixed depending if you use the RS or ME Bridge.
Use `rs_crafting` for the RS Bridge and `me_crafting` for the ME Bridge.
**Values:**

1. `error: boolean` If an error occurred and the calculation or crafting was not successful
2. `id: int` The id of the craft job. Can be used to get the craft object
3. `debug_message: string` A debug message describing the current task of the task

```lua linenums="1"
local event, error, id, message = os.pullEvent("rs_crafting")
print("A crafting update occurred for Job #" .. id)
if error then
    print("There was an error while calculating or crafting the resource with the message " .. message)
else 
    print("The new state of the task is " .. message)
end
```

### craftItem

```
craftItem(filter: table) -> table | nil, string
```

Schedules a craft job for items. Will fire the crafting event when changes occur.
Or nil if there was an issue with parsing the filter

---

### craftFluid

```
craftFluid(filter: table) -> table | nil, string
```

Schedules a craft job for fluids. Will fire the crafting event when changes occur.
Or nil if there was an issue with parsing the filter

---

### craftChemical

```
craftChemical(filter: table) -> table | nil, string
```

Schedules a craft job for mekanism chemicals. Will fire the crafting event when changes occur.
Or nil if there was an issue with parsing the filter

---

### getCraftingTasks

```
getCraftingTasks() -> table
```

Returns every crafting task that is currently running.

---

### getCraftingTask

```
getCraftingJob(id: int) -> table | nil, string
```

Returns the [Crafting Job Object](/../guides/storage_system_functions#crafting-job) with the id. Nil if no object could be found

---

### cancelCraftingTasks

```
cancelCraftingTasks(filter: table) -> int
```

Cancels every crafting task where the output matches the filter

---

### getPatterns

```
getPatterns(pattern_filter: table) -> table | nil, string
```

Returns every pattern available to the grid or nil if there was an issue with parsing one of the filters.
The filter of this function is a bit different

You **can** specify filters for the output and input of patterns. If you don't provide any filter or just no argument at
all, it will return every pattern.

To specify an input or output filter, you need to use an `input`/`output` key in the filters table.

For example

```lua linenums="1"
-- Filter for any patterns with sticks as an output
outputFilter = {
     output = { 
        name="minecraft:stick" 
     } 
}

-- Filter for any patterns with sticks as an input
inputFilter = {
     input = { 
        name="minecraft:stick" 
     } 
}

-- Filter for any patterns with sticks as an output and planks as an input
inputFilter = {
     input = {
        name = "minecraft:oak_planks"
     },
     output = { 
        name="minecraft:stick" 
     } 
}

-- Or use the function without argument to get every pattern
patterns = bridge.getPatterns()
```

---

### isCraftable

```
isCraftable(filter: table) -> boolean
```

Returns true if there is a pattern for the provided filter or nil if there was an issue with parsing the filter.
The filter can be an item filter, a chemical filter or a fluid filter. See [filter types](/../guides/filters/#types)

---

### isCrafting

```
isCrafting(filter: table) -> boolean
```

Returns true if there is a crafting job running for the provided filter or nil if there was an issue with parsing the
filter.
The filter can be an item filter, a chemical filter or a fluid filter. See [filter types](/../guides/filters/#types)

## Objects

Every object here is inherited from common lua objects, see [LuaObjects](/../guides/objects)
Please note that due to different natures of AE2 and RS that not every object is the same.

### Crafting Job

With the new crafting system, we have a complete new crafting job object. While the basic crafting job only offers some simple details, the actual job that manages the crafting offers everything that RS or AE2 would offer.
Tho these are no properties/fields, these are functions since always pulling these information would be a waste of time.

Represents a crafting job in the ME/RS system. Used for tracking crafting operations.
