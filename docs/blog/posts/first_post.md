# AP has a blog now!

Greetings party people! So, we've just launched a brand new blog where we'll be sharing all sorts of stuff - from updates on Advanced Peripherals (Especially for the upcoming major release) to some really cool examples of what you can do with it. We're also planning to create more detailed guides as time goes on, so you can get the
most out of AP.

Think of it like a behind-the-scenes look at how we're constantly improving Advanced Peripherals while we prepare the 0.8/1.0 update. We'll be sharing tips and tricks, as well as showcasing some amazing projects that have been built with it. It's going to be a great resource for anyone looking to get more out of Advanced
Peripherals, so keep an eye on it!
